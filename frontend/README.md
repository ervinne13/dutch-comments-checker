# Dutch Comments Checker Frontend

This is a React SPA built with Vite, Joy UI, and Recharts. It features:
- Subject list with comment and flagged counts
- Subject detail view with pie charts (spam, toxicity) and comments table
- Hardcoded data in `/src/data/subjects.js` for easy API integration

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
2. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

## Tech Stack
- React
- Joy UI (@mui/joy)
- Recharts

## Structure
- `/src/data/subjects.js`: Hardcoded data for subjects and comments
- `/src`: Main app code

Replace hardcoded data with API calls as needed.
